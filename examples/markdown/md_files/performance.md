# Performance & Concurrency in Rust

**Level 3**

This file explains how Rust is designed for **high performance** and **safe concurrency**. Here we explore topics such as *zero-cost abstractions* and the *concurrency model* that helps you write safe and efficient parallel code.

## Zero-Cost Abstractions

Rust provides **zero-cost abstractions**, meaning high-level code does not impose runtime overhead. Unlike traditional languages where abstraction can introduce performance penalties, Rust’s optimizations ensure that abstractions **compile down to efficient machine code**.

Move semantics help avoid unnecessary deep copies by transferring ownership efficiently. The compiler aggressively inlines functions for better performance. Static dispatch resolves traits at compile time, eliminating virtual table lookups.

## Concurrency Model

Rust’s concurrency model prevents common issues like **data races** and **race conditions** at compile time. Unlike languages that rely on runtime checks, Rust enforces **thread safety** through its **ownership system**.

Ownership and borrowing ensure that data cannot be accessed unsafely across threads, preventing issues like *use-after-free* and *dangling pointers*. The compiler guarantees thread safety, reducing runtime bugs. Using `std::sync` types like `Mutex<T>` and `RwLock<T>` ensures safe shared state.

The `Send` trait allows data to be safely transferred between threads, while the `Sync` trait ensures safe access to shared data. By enforcing **compile-time guarantees**, Rust makes writing concurrent programs **safe and efficient** without sacrificing performance.
