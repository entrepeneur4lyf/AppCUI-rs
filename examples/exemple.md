## Introduction

Rust is a statically typed language designed to eliminate common programming errors at compile time while delivering high performance.

### What Makes Rust Unique?

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model prevents null pointer dereferences and data races.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for safe, concurrent programming.
- **Performance**: Delivers speed comparable to C/C++.
- **Modern Syntax**: Offers clear, expressive code that is easy to maintain.

## Features

Rust provides several advanced features that set it apart:

### Ownership and Borrowing

Rust enforces strict rules for how memory is accessed and managed, ensuring that bugs like use-after-free and data races are caught at compile time.

### Concurrency

Rust's design promotes safe concurrency, enabling multithreaded programming without the typical pitfalls of shared mutable state.

Inline code example: `let x = 10;`

Block code example:

```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
