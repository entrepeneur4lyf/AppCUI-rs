# What is AppCUI

`AppCUI` is a cross-platform TUI (**T**ext **U**ser **I**nterface / **T**erminal **U**ser **I**nterface) / CUI (**C**onsole **U**ser **I**nterface) framework designed to allow quick creation TUI/CUI based applications. 
AppCUI has a lot of out-of-the-box controls (such as buttons, checkboxes, radioboxes, window, tab cotrols, lists, comboboxes, etc), and can also provide quick macros to create custom controls. 

The core of AppCUI is written completely in Rust and is designed to be fast and efficient. It is based on a handle-based system, where each control is represented by a handle. This allows for easy manipulation of controls and their properties.
